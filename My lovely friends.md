My lovely friends.

The bombs have dropped, and their mushroom clouds have blown away on the winds
of a nuclear winter. The desolate streets of Kingston, once a noble town, have
been reduced to rubble and clans squabbling over the spoils of a civilization
already forgotten. The warring is brutal - I saw a man killed with a duck.

You must join this fight. On Saturday, bring your strongest armour to Spoons, in
Kingston, at 6pm. We will dine, and the fight will commence at 7pm.

You need not bring weapons - these have been scattered throughout the town,
although most have already been gathered into loot piles in what used to be
local pubs and are now strongholds for the factions. Still, some undiscovered
caches must surely remain - perhaps you will find one.

You should, however, bring warm clothing and **a fully charged phone**.

May the best team win, and may God forgive us.

Gaby and Charles
