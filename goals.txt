  - [ ] Public scoreboard
  - [ ] 10 minutes timeout to be revived, then you are dead dead
  - [ ] Improve admin kill interface
Essential:

Bugs:
  - [ ] P0 - If you lock your phone for a while and repoen it, the streams do not reconnect



Backburner:

- [x] Admin interface UI should also auto-update
- [ ]: The admin interface should have a password
- [ ]: Users should be able to send items to other users (on their team? only bullets?)
- [x] Fixed by moving to SSE: Websockets: Having the game open in multiple tabs, I sometimes hit the browser persistent connections limit
- [ ] QR code interface for joining team
