Goals
-----

Bugs:
- [ ] Frontend doesn't work on iPhone!

Polish:
  - [ ] Improve admin kill interface
  - [ ] Location implementation:
    - [ ] Map in corner with own Location
    - [ ] Location reported to server regularly
    - [ ] Locations displayed on admin page
    - [ ] Hand-drawn map with pubs marked
    - [ ] Circles displayed on map, triggered by admins
    - [ ] 10-minute warning for out of circle (admins administer deaths every 60 seconds thereafter)
    - [ ] "Scanner" item which reveals other teams for x minutes
  - [ ] Heartbeat animation when knocked out
  - [ ] Handle shooting someone when they are already dead
  - [ ] Ability to delay decision for a shot while processing others (conflict with ordering)
  - [ ] Must implement refund for unsure shots
  - [ ] Should add private ticker entries for e.g. results of shots (different colour)

Non-code:
- [ ] Medkits are totally manual / admin controlled - only available in the first 60 minutes and only for a team shot in a pub
- [ ] Need write-up explaining the rules
    - [ ] Ideally this should be the team sheet which includes the QR code to sign up (useful for testing the app)
  - [ ] Collections:
    - Level 3 armour and the best gun only come from crates.
    - Level 1 armour is fairly common.
    - Level 2 is rare but on lampposts
    - Level 2 gun is mediumly rare on lampposts
    - Quick-shoot gun is very rare and also in crates
- We will have 4-6 people per team. We will decide the teams in advance

Checks:
 - [ ] Harry and Gaby were not getting updates. I think this is fixed by the timeout but I should check
 - [ ] Images are now higher res and lag is reduced - this needs to be checked live

Backburner:

- [x] Admin interface UI should also auto-update
- [ ]: The admin interface should have a password
- [ ]: Users should be able to send items to other users (on their team? only bullets?)
- [x] Fixed by moving to SSE: Websockets: Having the game open in multiple tabs, I sometimes hit the browser persistent connections limit
- [ ] QR code interface for joining team
- [ ] Flash the torch on shots - probably not, only possible on Android
