Goals
-----

- [ ] Polish:
  - [ ] Public scoreboard
  - [ ] 10 minutes timeout to be revived, then you are dead dead
    - [ ] Needs asyncio bump on timeout since frontend uses "state". Or JS could update itself
  - [ ] Improve admin kill interface
  - [ ] Flash the torch on shots
  - [x] LOADS more items. We need:
    - [x] A gun that hits for 2
    - [x] A gun that fires every second
    - [x] A gun that hits for 3!
    - [ ] Images for all guns
  - [ ] Location implementation:
    - [ ] Map in corner with own Location
    - [ ] Location reported to server regularly
    - [ ] Locations displayed on admin page
    - [ ] Hand-drawn map with pubs marked
    - [ ] Circles displayed on map, triggered by admins
    - [ ] 10-minute warning for out of circle (admins administer deaths every 60 seconds thereafter)
    - [ ] "Scanner" item which reveals other teams for x minutes
  - [ ] Heartbeat animation when knocked out
  - [ ] Put fullscreen button back even in fullscreen

Non-code:
- [ ] Medkits are totally manual / admin controlled - only available in the first 60 minutes and only for a team shot in a pub
- [ ] Need write-up explaining the rules
    - [ ] Ideally this should be the team sheet which includes the QR code to sign up (useful for testing the app)
  - [ ] Collections:
    - Level 3 armour and the best gun only come from crates.
    - Level 1 armour is fairly common.
    - Level 2 is rare but on lampposts
    - Level 2 gun is mediumly rare on lampposts
    - Quick-shoot gun is very rare and also in crates
- We will have 4-6 people per team. We will decide the teams in advance

Essential:
  - [x] Sort out HTTPS / production server
  - [x] Armour should act like armour, i.e. doesn't stack
  - [x] When someone dies their future shots are cancelled and refunded (to prevent out-of-order errors)

Done but unchecked:
  - [x] Add ticker messages for kills
Bugs:
  - [ ] P0 - If you lock your phone for a while and repoen it, the streams do not reconnect
  - [ ] Gaby could not scan anything
  - [ ] Harry's phone didn't update the ammo count


Backburner:

- [x] Admin interface UI should also auto-update
- [ ]: The admin interface should have a password
- [ ]: Users should be able to send items to other users (on their team? only bullets?)
- [x] Fixed by moving to SSE: Websockets: Having the game open in multiple tabs, I sometimes hit the browser persistent connections limit
- [ ] QR code interface for joining team
