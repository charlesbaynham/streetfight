Goals
-----

TODO:
 - [x] Generic text messages from admin
 - [x] Fix pickup of level 1 gun
 - [ ] Drop location
 - [x] Admin names
 - [x] Show scoreboard in dead mode
 - [ ] Improve admin kill interface
 - [x] Admins should have ticker view
  - [ ] Ticker view should actually update...

  - [x] Reset should fire all game events

Bugs:
- [ ] There's a big memory leak in the events... Try debugging with "LOG_OVERRIDES=backend.sse_event_streams:DEBUG" and refresh the admin page a few times
- [x] iPhone location does not work - maybe fixed, ask Rob
- [x] Location permission should be requested on start screen

- [x] The camera doesn't work properly on safari! When I reconnect from standby
      it's white until a refresh. This breaks the PWA. Seems to be the fault of react
      webcam, I can use it fine on a normal HTML5 demo site. Guess I'm coding my own
      webcam widget... Urghq
- [ ] Somewhere in the giant iOS clusterfuck, the Permissions API for proper browsers got messed up - actually I think maybe it never worked properly for firefox + geolocation


Location:
  Not a priority, but I'm apparently doing it anyway. Classic.
  - [x] When a shot happens, record where everyone was so the interface can suggest who was closest
  - [x] Hand-drawn map with pubs marked
  - [ ] Circles displayed on map, triggered by admins
  - [ ] Disable pubs when outside circle
  - [ ] 10-minute warning for out of circle (admins administer deaths every 60 seconds thereafter)
  - [ ] "Scanner" item which reveals other teams for x minutes

Priority:
  - [x] You should be stuck on the home screen until the appropriate permissions are given
  - [x] Needs a "hit" noise / notification
  - [x] You should find out if you hit someone (use private tickers)
  - [x] Need to be able to change your name... People will be silly

Polish:
  - [ ] Make ticker messages disappear eventually. Clientside.
  - [x] The animation for the bullet reload is jerky
  - [ ] Put harry's noises in
    * time splitters 2 ricochet
    * random selection of western ricochet shots
  - [ ] Clicking outside the socre card should exit it

  - [ ] Heartbeat animation when knocked out
  - [ ] Handle shooting someone when they are already dead
  - [ ] Ability to delay decision for a shot while processing others (conflict with ordering)
  - [ ] Must implement refund for unsure shots
  - [ ] Consider having the UI anticipate events from the server - this would make it more responsive
  - [ ] Use new QR code API if available (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Barcode_Detection_API)

Non-code:
- [ ] Medkits are totally manual / admin controlled - only available in the first 60 minutes and only for a team shot in a pub
- [ ] Need write-up explaining the rules
    - [ ] Ideally this should be the team sheet which includes the QR code to sign up (useful for testing the app)
  - [ ] Collections:
    - Level 3 armour and the best gun only come from crates.
    - Level 1 armour is fairly common.
    - Level 2 is rare but on lampposts
    - Level 2 gun is mediumly rare on lampposts
    - Quick-shoot gun is very rare and also in crates
- We will have 4-6 people per team. We will decide the teams in advance

Checks:
 - [ ] Harry and Gaby were not getting updates. I think this is fixed by the timeout but I should check
 - [ ] Images are now higher res and lag is reduced - this needs to be checked live

Backburner:

- [x] Admin interface UI should also auto-update
- [x]: The admin interface should have a password
- [ ]: Users should be able to send items to other users (on their team? only bullets?)
- [x] Fixed by moving to SSE: Websockets: Having the game open in multiple tabs, I sometimes hit the browser persistent connections limit
- [ ] QR code interface for joining team
- [ ] Flash the torch on shots - probably not, only possible on Android
