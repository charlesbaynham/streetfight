Bugs:
- The animation for the bullet reload is jerky

Location:
  Not a priority, but I'm apparently doing it anyway. Classic.
  - [ ] When a shot happens, record where everyone was so the interface can suggest who was closest
  - [ ] Hand-drawn map with pubs marked
  - [ ] Circles displayed on map, triggered by admins
  - [ ] 10-minute warning for out of circle (admins administer deaths every 60 seconds thereafter)
  - [ ] "Scanner" item which reveals other teams for x minutes

Priority:
  - [ ] Needs a "hit" noise / notification
  - [ ] You should find out if you hit someone (use private tickers)

Polish:
  - [ ] Make ticker messages disappear eventually. Clientside.
  - [ ] Put harry's noises in
    * time splitters 2 ricochet
    * random selection of western ricochet shots
  - [ ] Show scoreboard in dead mode
  - [ ] Improve admin kill interface
  - [ ] Clicking outside the socre card should exit it

  - [ ] Heartbeat animation when knocked out
  - [ ] Handle shooting someone when they are already dead
  - [ ] Ability to delay decision for a shot while processing others (conflict with ordering)
  - [ ] Must implement refund for unsure shots
  - [ ] Consider having the UI anticipate events from the server - this would make it more responsive
  - [ ] Use new QR code API if available (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Barcode_Detection_API)

Non-code:
- [ ] Medkits are totally manual / admin controlled - only available in the first 60 minutes and only for a team shot in a pub
- [ ] Need write-up explaining the rules
    - [ ] Ideally this should be the team sheet which includes the QR code to sign up (useful for testing the app)
  - [ ] Collections:
    - Level 3 armour and the best gun only come from crates.
    - Level 1 armour is fairly common.
    - Level 2 is rare but on lampposts
    - Level 2 gun is mediumly rare on lampposts
    - Quick-shoot gun is very rare and also in crates
- We will have 4-6 people per team. We will decide the teams in advance

Checks:
 - [ ] Harry and Gaby were not getting updates. I think this is fixed by the timeout but I should check
 - [ ] Images are now higher res and lag is reduced - this needs to be checked live

Backburner:

- [x] Admin interface UI should also auto-update
- [ ]: The admin interface should have a password
- [ ]: Users should be able to send items to other users (on their team? only bullets?)
- [x] Fixed by moving to SSE: Websockets: Having the game open in multiple tabs, I sometimes hit the browser persistent connections limit
- [ ] QR code interface for joining team
- [ ] Flash the torch on shots - probably not, only possible on Android
